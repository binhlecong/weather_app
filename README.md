# Weather_app
A new Flutter project in which I learn how to fetch api and learn many new UI features.

## Features
- [x] weather object
- [x] fetch API
- [x] coordinate input
- [x] bottom button bar
- [x] Option tabs for showing UV, temperature and wind graph
- [x] swipe down to reload
- [x] Use BLoC to add favorite location, darkmode, setting
- [x] Setting: choose degree F, C or K
- [x] Setting: choose wind speed unit
- [x] Store recent search data
- [x] Store favorite locations data
- [ ] Use images in DetailView to make app look better
- [ ] Tap on future day summary to view detail of that day

## Lesson learned
- The "widget" folder is for reusable widget only
- The layout is in the screen
