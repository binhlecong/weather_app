# Weather_app
A new Flutter project in which I learn how to work with api and learn many new UI features.

## Demo
- Home screen
  <p float="left">
    <img src="assets/screenshot/home_light.png" width="200" />
    <img src="assets/screenshot/home_dark.png" width="200" /> 
  </p>
- Setting screen (dark mode, unit of measurement)
  <p float="left">
    <img src="assets/screenshot/setting_light.png" width="200" />
    <img src="assets/screenshot/setting_dark.png" width="200" /> 
  </p>
- See weather of a city or a coordinate in detail
  <p>
    <img src="assets/screenshot/detail.png" width="200" />
    <img src="assets/screenshot/detail2.png" width="200" /> 
  </p>
- Search page
  <p>
    <img src="assets/screenshot/search.png" width="200" /> 
  </p>
- See weather anywhere in the world using map
  <p>
    <img src="assets/screenshot/map.png" width="200" /> 
  </p>
- Save a collection of cities that your are interested in
  <p>
    <img src="assets/screenshot/favorite.png" width="200" /> 
  </p>
