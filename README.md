# Weather_app
A new Flutter project in which I learn how to fetch api and learn many new UI features.

## To do list
- [x] weather object
- [x] fetch API
- [x] coordinate input
- [x] bottom button bar
- [x] Option tabs for showing UV, temperature and wind graph
- [x] swipe down to reload
- [x] Use BLoC to add favorite location, darkmode, setting
- [x] Setting: choose degree F, C or K
- [x] Setting: choose wind speed unit
- [x] Store recent search data
- [x] Search is laggy, fix it
- [x] Use images in DetailView to make app look better
- [x] Show weather at user's position on top
- [x] Parallax background in detail view
- [x] Smooth animation
- [x] Store favorite locations data
- [ ] Delete search data
- [ ] Drag and drop to reposition weather tile

## Lesson learned
- The "widget" folder is for reusable widget only
- The layout is in the screen
